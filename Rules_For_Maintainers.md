These are the basic rules for **Developers & Maintainers** of 
**The PixelDust Project**. 

## Rules
- Maintainers must behave properly & be friendly with other members,
  They must not troll, insult, use hate words, do personal attacks
  or any action that is unacceptable towards the creation of a positive
  environment.
- The sources of the device being used must be open for forking, inspection
  etc. Maintainers may host their trees at [Pixeldust Devices](https://github.com/pixeldust-devices)
  github organization. If not, they must provide a link to their Device 
  sources on their support thread.
- Maintainers must not release modded builds officially,
  Official builds must not contain anything more or less than what
  ROM source provides at that moment.
- The device must not have any outside dependencies. All dependencies
  must be open sourced and ready to be fork with proper commit history.
- Maintainers must provide changelogs for each build.
